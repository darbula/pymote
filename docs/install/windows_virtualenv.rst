Windows virtualenv installation
*******************************
.. warning::

    This installation procedure is much more involved then the one using WinPython as described in :doc:`installation`. Without good reason please use WinPython version.
    
Python
======
    
Install Python 2.7 using appropriate installer: `Python 2.7.3 x86 MSI Installer <http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi>`_

.. warning::

    After installation append paths to ``python.exe`` (i.e. ``C:\Python27``) and path to directory 
    ``Scripts`` (i.e. ``C:\Python27\Scripts``) in the PATH 
    `environment variable <http://superuser.com/a/284351/169714>`_.


Virtualenv
==========

Instead of installing packages systemwide in these instructions we use `virtualenv`_ to create an
isolated Python environment and then install packages into this environment. This procedure is
more demanding but has the advantage of being independent from the rest of the system.

To install ``virtualenv`` first install ``distribute`` and ``pip``:

#.  download `distribute_setup.py <http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py>`_
#.  download `get-pip.py <https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py>`_
#.  enter elevated/administrator command prompt: right click on the Command prompt icon and select
    Run as administrator

        .. image:: _images/command_prompt_administrator.png
           :align: center

#.  Navigate to the directory where the files were downloaded (i.e. ``C:\Users\user\Desktop``) and
    run following commands::
    
        C:\> cd Users\user\Desktop
        C:\Users\user\Desktop> python distribute_setup.py
        C:\Users\user\Desktop> python get-pip.py

#.  After this distribute should be installed so downloaded files and temporary ``build`` directory 
    can be deleted.

#.  Install ``virtualenv``::

        C:\Users\user\Desktop> pip install virtualenv

.. note::

    When the installation of ``virtualenv`` is completed the elevated/administrator Command prompt
    is not needed anymore so it can be closed. All subsequent commands should go in the regular 
    Command prompt.

Pymote virtual environment
--------------------------

#.  To make a virtual environment in which all other packages are going to be installed first
    navigate to the directory in which you want to set up environment. This can be any directory and
    in the following steps we use ``C:\Users\user\Documents``::

        C:\Users\user> cd C:\Users\user\Documents
        C:\Users\user\Documents> virtualenv pymote_env
        New python executable in pymote_env\Scripts\python.exe
        Installing setuptools................done.
        Installing pip...................done.
    
    This command has made a new directory ``pymote_env`` inside ``C:\Users\user\Documents`` with
    separate python interpreter and two necessary packages. 

.. _windows-venvact:

#.  Activate environment::

        C:\Users\user\Documents> pymote_env\Scripts\activate
        (pymote_env) C:\Users\user\Documents>
    
    .. note::

        The ``(pymote_env)`` prefix to prompt in the last line indicates that newly created environment
        is activated. All subsequently installed packages from this modified command prompt end up in
        the activated environment. Environment can be deactivated with command ``deactivate``.

#.  Set ``PYMOTE_ENV`` environment variable as path to ``pymote_env`` directory. This way all
    executables that are not being started from the modified command prompt should know where
    to look for the environment and its packages.

    .. note::

        In Windows Vista and later use command ``setx PYMOTE_ENV "C:\path\to\pymote_env"`` to save
        environment variable permanently. In XP use the normal way through Control Panel (`instructions <http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/sysdm_advancd_environmnt_addchange_variable.mspx?mfr=true>`_).

#.  Launch text editor (use `Notepad++ <http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download>`_ or WordPad, do not
    use plain Notepad) and open ``pymote_env\Scripts\activate.bat`` file. To display the ``.bat``
    files in open dialog you have to chose All Documents (\*.\*) from the file types dropdown.

#.  Add line ``set IPYTHONDIR=%VIRTUAL_ENV%\.ipython`` *below* the line that sets ``VIRTUAL_ENV``
    environment variable, near the top. Save the document. This way IPython package which is not
    yet fully compatible with the virtualenv knows where to look for its conguration files.
  
#.  Open ``pymote_env\Scripts\deactivate.bat`` in text editor and insert line ``set IPYTHONDIR=`` 
    just below the line ``@echo off``, near the top of the document. Save the document. 

.. warning::

    After setting the environment variable and modifying ``activate.bat`` and ``deactivate.bat``
    scripts you must restart the Command prompt and reenter/reactivate ``pymote_env``. If all goes
    well commands ``echo %PYMOTE_ENV%`` and ``echo %IPYTHONDIR%`` should print environment paths.

Required packages
=================

All required packages are installed in the environment created in the previous section so before
continuing ensure that the environment is activated. Active environment is indicated with prompt 
prefix i.e. ``(pymote_env)``.

NumPy and SciPy
---------------
Since normal installation of these packages requires compiling we make a shortcut by using 
precompiled binaries and installing them into virtual environment using
`this solution <http://stackoverflow.com/a/6753898/1247955>`_:

#.  Download 
    NumPy binary `numpy-1.7.0-win32-superpack-python2.7.exe <http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.7.0/numpy-1.7.0-win32-superpack-python2.7.exe/download>`_ and 
    SciPy binary `scipy-0.11.0-win32-superpack-python2.7.exe <http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/0.11.0/scipy-0.11.0-win32-superpack-python2.7.exe/download>`_.
    
    .. note::
    
        Newer versions of `NumPy <http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/>`__ and 
        `SciPy <http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/>`__ may be available.
        

#.  Do not run downloaded ``.exe`` files as that would install them systemwide. Instead *extract* 
    them (with `7-zip <http://www.7-zip.org/download.html>`_) in some temporary
    directory i.e. ``C:\Users\user\Desktop``.

#.  Based on your processor support of `SSE <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions>`_ 
    instructions (probably sse3, see the note below) install appropriate extracted ``.exe`` files
    (nosse|sse2|sse3) using ``easy_install`` command::
    
        (pymote_env) C:\Users\user\Desktop> easy_install numpy-1.7.0-[nosse|sse2|sse3].exe
        (pymote_env) C:\Users\user\Desktop> easy_install scipy-0.11.0-[nosse|sse2|sse3].exe
    
    .. note::

        SSE3 instructions are supported by all 
        `reasonably modern processors <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE3#CPUs_with_SSE3>`_. If 
        you're not sure try `CPU-Z <http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Info/CPU-Z.shtml>`_.
        
After installation all downloaded and extracted files can be deleted.


Matplotlib
----------
Matplotlib package
is installed almost the same way as NumPy and SciPy packages in previous section using the
appropriate binary `matplotlib-1.2.0.win32-py2.7.exe <https://github.com/downloads/matplotlib/matplotlib/matplotlib-1.2.0.win32-py2.7.exe>`_.
The only difference is in the 3rd step where the extracted contents from directory 
``PLATLIB`` should be copied to ``pymote_env/Lib/site-packages/`` directory::

    C:\Users\user\Desktop> xcopy /s matplotlib-1.2.0.win32-py2.7\PLATLIB\* %PYMOTE_ENV%\Lib\site-packages


Pyreadline
----------
For Pyreadline package use ``easy_install`` as ``pip`` currently installs version
1.7.1.dev-r0 which does not work well with IPython:

.. code-block:: bash

    (pymote_env)> easy_install pyreadline


PySide
------
For Pymote GUI part of the library PySide Qt bindings for Python should be installed. This is 
achieved `using this solution <http://stackoverflow.com/a/4673823/1247955>`__, that is, running 
following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    (pymote_env)> easy_install PySide
    (pymote_env)> python pymote_env\Scripts\pyside_postinstall.py -install
    
Pymote
======
Finally, in order to download and install Pymote and all other required packages there are two
aviliable options, use one of them:

#. Stable: for latest stable version use package from PyPI::
    
    (pymote_env)> pip install pymote

#. Development: to install latest development version of the Pymote use source from github repo::
    
    (pymote_env)> pip install -e git+https://github.com/darbula/pymote.git#egg=Pymote
    
.. _pymote-deps:

To list all packages installed in the environment run ``pip freeze``. The output should look 
something like this::

    (pymote_env)> pip freeze
    Pymote==0.1.1
    ipython==0.13.1
    matplotlib==1.2.0
    networkx==1.7
    numpy==1.6.2
    pypng==0.0.14
    pyreadline==1.7.1
    pyside==1.1.2
    scipy==0.11.0
    

Starting Pymote
===============

Before starting, make sure that virtual environment is activated :ref:`windows <windows-venvact>` and run ``ipymote`` for interactive console or ``pymote-simgui`` for simualtion GUI. For more details refer to :doc:`starting`.


Additional customization
------------------------

The recommended way to avoid starting command prompt, activating the virtual environment and running ``ipymote`` in it is to make a shortcut to the ``ipymote.exe`` file on the desktop, taskbar or start menu.

You can customize prompt can be additionaly customized by right clicking on the shortcut and selecting Properties from the menu. Highly recommended customizations are:

* in Options tab enable QuickEdit mode
* in Font tab change font to Consolas and size to 16
* in Layout tab increase Screen buffer size Height from 300 to at least 3000

The loading of the correct environment when shortcut is double clicked is possible via previously set ``PYMOTE_ENV`` environment variable which points to the environment location.
