directory. All tests should be found recursively scanning directories.
To run all tests run this from root pymote directory::

    nosetests -v

To run selected test module::

    nosetests -v pymote.tests.test_algorithm

    pip install coverage
    coverage run --source=pymote setup.py nosetests
    
`Configuration file <http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/config.html#config>`_ is in ``.coveragerc``.

Make report in console or html::
